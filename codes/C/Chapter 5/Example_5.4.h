// f is a pointer of an array of integers whose values are between 1 and n.And it is the mapping method of S.
// n is the number of the elements of f
// S is a pointer of a subset of the integers from 1 to n
// The return is a new S.When S[i](-1<i<n) is not 0, i+1 is a element of S.And for the new S, f is an one to one mapping on it.
